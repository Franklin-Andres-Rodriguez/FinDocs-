# Requirements Documentation: AI-Powered Modular Financial Dashboard

## Executive Summary

This document presents the definition, requirements, and implementation plan for developing a web platform with AI-Powered Modular Financial Dashboard Architecture. The system is designed to democratize financial analysis, enabling both experts and beginners to extract, interpret, and analyze information from complex financial documents.

---

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 General Description

Investors (especially those without technical financial training) face considerable difficulty when attempting to extract, interpret, and analyze relevant information from extensive and technically complex financial documents such as SEC filings. This barrier to entry limits informed participation in financial markets and creates disadvantages for individual investors.

### 1.2 Current Context

Existing market solutions:
- Are designed for financial professionals with advanced technical knowledge
- Require significant time investment for manual analysis of extensive documents
- Have prohibitive costs for individual investors (professional analysis services)
- Present steep learning curves that exclude beginners

### 1.3 Problem Magnitude

This situation affects millions of individual investors, small businesses, and even financial professionals who spend unnecessary hours on tasks that could be automated. The average time to analyze a 10-K/10-Q report can exceed 4-6 hours for a professional and days for a beginner.

### 1.4 Current Solutions and Limitations

| Current Solution | Primary Limitations |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Professional financial analysis services | High costs, limited perspective |
| Traditional financial platforms | Designed for experts, complex interface |
| Manual data extraction | Time-intensive, error-prone |
| Existing automated tools | Limited accuracy, poor explanatory capability |
