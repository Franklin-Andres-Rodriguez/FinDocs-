# Simple MVP Technical Plan
## Financial Document Analyzer - Zero Budget Edition



---

## 1. Problema Validado Cuantitativamente para MVP

### 1.1 Core Problem Statement (Validated)

**Primary Pain Point**: Los usuarios que analizan documentos financieros invierten **3 horas diarias** (15+ horas semanales) en lectura y análisis manual de documentos SEC, representando un costo de oportunidad de $54,000+ anuales.

**Quantified Impact**: 
- **Time Investment**: 3 horas por documento × uso diario = 1,095 horas/año
- **Economic Cost**: $54,750/año en tiempo perdido (@ $50/hora)
- **Target Reduction**: 70% time savings = $38,300/año value creation

**MVP Solution**: Herramienta que reduce el tiempo de análisis de 3 horas a <1 hora mediante automatización IA y display profesional optimizado para uso diario.
